# ðŸŒ„ Images to PDF ðŸ“„



## Background

Many times in my past I've missed a tool for easily converting number of images into one or many PDF files, and adjust the quality and therefore the size on-the-fly as well as when my wife been asking how she'd convert "photographed" A4 pages into PDF so I took a swing and developed this little tool that for sure will aid me and perhaps other may find use of.
